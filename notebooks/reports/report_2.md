Identifying a High-Quality Arabic WordNet Resource
Current AWN v2: Limitations at a Glance
The Open Multilingual WordNet Arabic (AWN v2) has proven inadequate for our needs. An internal evaluation highlighted several critical gaps:
	•	No Native Arabic Glosses or Examples: AWN v2 provides zero Arabic definitions or usage examples for its synsets, relying entirely on English glosses[1]. This makes it unusable for Arabic speakers.
	•	Limited Coverage: With ~11,269 synsets (only ~8–9% of the Princeton WordNet’s scope), AWN v2’s lexicon is very sparse[2]. Key parts of speech are underrepresented – adjectives cover only ~5.9% and adverbs ~2.9% of their English counterparts (per our analysis). Core vocabulary coverage is similarly low.
	•	Incomplete Diacritization: Only ~28.6% of Arabic lemmas in AWN v2 are fully vocalized (voweled). The majority lack diacritics, hindering correct interpretation for homographs.
	•	Synset Granularity Issues: AWN v2 inherits many English-oriented sense distinctions, causing imbalance. On one hand, it “over-splits” certain Arabic words into too many senses (e.g. 512 Arabic lemmas have 10+ senses, reflecting fine English distinctions unnatural in Arabic). On the other hand, it “over-lumps” disparate meanings: hundreds of synsets (≈782 by our count) contain 10+ near-synonyms where some members are semantically unrelated. This results in conflated synsets that mix different concepts. For example, AWN v2’s synset for “noise” ended up lumping erroneous terms and missing a correct synonym[3]. These issues align with previous critiques that “AWN has very poor content in both quantity and quality”[4].
(Our attached report provides full statistics and examples of these issues.)
Given these deficiencies, we seek an alternative Arabic lexical-semantic resource that meets our project’s requirements for native Arabic content, broader coverage, and higher quality.
Requirements Recap
Must-Have Criteria: A suitable resource should have native Arabic definitions for ≥80% of synsets, Arabic example sentences, adequate coverage (≥20k synsets, balanced POS distribution, 95%+ core vocab), and cross-lingual alignment (ILI or mapping to English WordNet).
High-Priority: It should feature consistent diacritization (preferably ≥80% fully vocalized), appropriate sense granularity (reflecting Arabic usage rather than directly copying English distinctions), and evidence of quality assurance (expert review or published evaluations).
Desirable: Bonus features include morphological info (roots, patterns, broken plurals), dialectal markings (MSA vs. dialect if applicable), domain coverage with labels, and active maintenance (recent updates and responsive maintainers).
With these criteria in mind, we surveyed existing Arabic WordNets and similar resources. Below is a shortlist of promising candidates, followed by our recommendation.
Candidate Arabic Lexical-Semantic Resources
	•	Revised Arabic WordNet (AWN 3.0 – 2024) – University of Trento & PTUK collaboration.
	•	Overview: This is a major revision of AWN published in 2024[5]. The team addressed AWN v2’s quality issues by systematically adding missing Arabic content and correcting errors. Notably, they added Arabic glosses (definitions) and example sentences for all synsets, improving the resource’s utility for Arabic users[6][7]. They also removed incorrect or duplicate lemmas and introduced new structures for untranslatable concepts (lexical gaps) and multi-word expressions (phrasets)[5].
	•	Coverage & POS: AWN 3.0 encompasses 9,576 synsets in total, containing ~20,560 Arabic word senses[8][9]. This is slightly fewer synsets than AWN v2, because the authors pruned many erroneous entries while adding some new ones. The POS distribution remains noun-heavy: ~6,500 noun synsets, 2,500 verb synsets, and relatively few adjectives (~446) and adverbs (~107)[10][11]. In percentage terms, adjectives (~4.7%) and adverbs (~1.1%) are still underrepresented, partly reflecting the original AWN’s gaps. However, the revision did add a number of new verb synsets and other lemmas to improve balance[11][12].
	•	Native Arabic Content: Yes – Nearly all synsets now include Arabic definitions and at least one Arabic usage example. The authors report updating >58% of AWN’s synsets with added glosses/examples and corrections[5]. For example, where AWN v2 had none, AWN 3.0 provides an Arabic gloss and illustrative sentence for each concept, greatly enhancing interpretability.
	•	Diacritization: Partial. AWN 3.0 focuses on correctness of lemmas; it’s unclear if all entries are fully vocalized. The resource likely follows a disambiguation-by-diacritics policy – critical differences are marked with tashkeel when needed. (The original AWN had some diacritics, but only ~28% fully; AWN 3.0 may have improved this as part of lemma correction, though the authors did not explicitly state a percentage in the paper.)
	•	Granularity: Improved. The revision explicitly tackled “excessive polysemy” by eliminating redundant senses[6]. They avoided blindly inheriting English sense splits that don’t apply to Arabic (e.g. they merged or dropped some of the 10+ sense clusters). Conversely, they added missing synonyms to synsets to ensure completeness[13]. The introduction of phrasets (multi-word expressions) and lexical gap indicators means AWN 3.0 can represent concepts that Arabic expresses with phrases or has no single-word equivalent[14]. This makes the resource more Arabic-centric in how concepts are grouped.
	•	Quality Assurance: This work was done by linguists and reviewed as an ACL Workshop paper. They cite systematically validating synsets (checking each gloss, example, and lemma)[13]. Over 5,500 synsets were updated by human effort[12]. The improvement is evidenced by examples in their paper and by addressing known issues from prior studies (they cite Batita & Zrigui’s critique and show how they fixed those errors[4][1]).
	•	Cross-lingual Alignment: The resource remains aligned to Princeton WordNet (PWN 2.0/3.0). Every synset has an interlingual identifier linking it to the corresponding English synset. (AWN 3.0 didn’t break that alignment; it only enriched or trimmed the Arabic side.) It thus supports interoperability with other WordNets and multilingual WordNet projects.
	•	Access: Open and free for research. The authors describe AWN 3.0 as “freely available”[15]. It is likely to be released via the Global WordNet Association or Open Multilingual WordNet. (As of mid-2024, one might obtain it by contacting the authors or checking if it’s on the GWA website. We can provide contact info: e.g., Dr. Abed Alhakim Freihat and Dr. Hadi Khalilia – emails in the paper[16].)
	•	Known Limitations: Coverage is only ~9.5k synsets, well below our 20k target. Despite quality gains, it still lacks many entries present in English WordNet (covering <10% of PWN). Adjectives and adverbs remain sparse. In addition, being a recent academic output, it may not have undergone wide community testing yet. We should also verify the license (likely CC BY-NC). If our project demands 100% open commercial use, the license needs checking. Lastly, maintaining AWN 3.0 or extending it would require engaging its creators or dedicating effort, as it’s a one-time revision (not an actively maintained commercial product).
	•	The Arabic Ontology (Birzeit University) – “Ontologically Clean” Arabic WordNet.
	•	Overview: The BZU Arabic Ontology is a comprehensive formal Arabic WordNet developed by Mustafa Jarrar et al. (2018–2021)[17]. Unlike traditional WordNets built by translation, this resource is built bottom-up with ontological principles. It provides a formal concept hierarchy (upper ontology) and attaches Arabic words as lexicalizations of these concepts. Importantly, it’s designed to be “ontologically clean”: each concept is rigorously defined and vetted against scientific and lexicographic sources, aiming to avoid the inconsistencies found in WordNets[18][17]. In essence, it doubles as an ontology and a WordNet.
	•	Coverage & POS: As of 2021, the Arabic Ontology included about 12,300 concepts (synsets): roughly 1,300 core concepts fully validated by experts, plus ~11,000 additional concepts partially validated[17]. The project has been expanding; a recent report notes it now has “more than 20k concepts” in total[19], indicating significant growth. This meets our coverage criterion. The ontology covers all primary POS – especially nouns and verbs (which form the bulk of concepts). Adjectives and adverbs appear to be included as needed, though the resource is structured more by conceptual categories than by POS quotas. (We don’t have exact POS counts, but given 20k concepts, likely >60% nouns, a substantial number of verbs, and a smaller proportion of adjectives/adverbs similar to WordNet’s distribution.) Importantly, the ontology’s concept hierarchy can handle things like descriptive adjectives via subsumption (e.g., “color qualities” etc.), which might reduce the need for separate synsets for every adjective.
	•	Native Arabic Content: Yes – every concept in the Arabic Ontology is defined in Arabic. The project provides Arabic glosses (definitions) for concepts in a formal yet clear style[20][21]. These are written for Arabic speakers, not just translations of English. Jarrar (2006, 2021) outlines guidelines for crafting concise Arabic glosses that capture the essential meaning of each concept[22][23]. For example, a concept like “social object” is defined in Arabic by its distinguishing features, rather than borrowed from an English gloss[21]. This focus on native definitions aligns perfectly with our requirements (well over 80% of synsets have Arabic definitions – essentially 100% of the validated concepts do).
	•	Arabic Usage Examples: Partially – The Arabic Ontology includes example usage or illustrative instances for many concepts. In the online portal (ontology.birzeit.edu), a “Concept Profile” displays the concept’s gloss and often an example sentence or context for clarity[24]. Additionally, because the ontology is linked to a large lexicographic database of 150 Arabic dictionaries[25], users can retrieve example sentences and attestations from those sources. While we don’t have a statistic like “X% of synsets have examples,” the core concepts likely have usage examples given the emphasis on clarity. The presence of a rich lexicographic backend (including modern and classical dictionaries) means example sentences are readily available or can be generated. This may fulfill the example criterion at least for the core vocabulary (and is something we could collaboratively improve by adding more examples for remaining concepts).
	•	Cross-lingual Alignment: Excellent. The Arabic Ontology is fully mapped to Princeton WordNet’s Interlingual Index and beyond. According to Jarrar (2021), it is “fully mapped with Princeton WordNet, Wikidata, and other resources.”[25] Each Arabic concept corresponds to an English synset (if one exists) and has links to Wikidata concepts. In fact, the resource can be seen as an Arabic WordNet interoperable with global semantic networks. This satisfies our interoperability needs (alignment for cross-lingual applications).
	•	Diacritization: Consistent (with policy). Since the ontology focuses on precise meanings, it typically provides fully vocalized forms for Arabic terms where needed. For instance, homographs are distinguished by diacritics on the lexicon search engine. The integration with classical dictionaries (which are vowelized) further ensures that root forms and patterns are known. We anticipate that ≥80% of the lemma entries are vocalized in some fashion. The project likely applies a policy: critical disambiguating diacritics are included in lemma display, while well-known forms might be shown without vowels unless necessary. Overall, it should be far more consistent than AWN v2 in this regard.
	•	Granularity & Synset Quality: Very high. This resource was built specifically to avoid the pitfalls of “translating English WordNet”. Each concept was vetted via what the authors call “ontological analysis”. This means they did not automatically import all fine-grained English senses if Arabic doesn’t distinguish them. Conversely, they introduced new concepts where Arabic has important distinctions. The result is that synset sizes and sense counts are more appropriate for Arabic usage. For example, if English “bank” has separate senses for financial vs. river bank, those would be separate concepts; but English “center” with 18 senses might be organized differently in Arabic. (The AWN 3.0 team noted that the Arabic Ontology explicitly handles issues like compound noun polysemy that plague WordNet[26][27].) We expect far less over-lumping: synonyms in a concept are truly synonymous in Arabic, since they validated them against actual Arabic lexicons. Similarly, over-splitting is reduced: one Arabic concept may align to multiple PWN senses if the English made unnecessary distinctions. This approach yields a clean structure more suitable to Arabic semantics.
	•	Morphological Info: Yes (Desirable feature). The Arabic Ontology is part of a larger Arabic Lexicographic Database (called Qamos or Jarrar’s Lexicographic Search Engine)[25]. Through this, each term is linked to its root (جذر) and any number of dictionaries that list its inflections and patterns. In the portal, one can typically see the root and measure (وزن) for a given word, as well as plural forms, verb conjugation info, etc., drawn from traditional lexicons[28][29]. The ontology itself encodes some morpho-semantic relations (the paper’s Figure 4 shows an example of relating forms). While not a full morphological analyzer, this resource does check that each lemma’s root and pattern are correct, and these can be leveraged. This directly addresses our “morphological information” wish.
	•	Dialect Awareness: The focus is on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Dialectal variants are not the main scope, though the ontology is aware of classical vs. modern usages (given it includes classical lexicons). There isn’t an explicit dialect tag for entries; however, if a concept is specific to a dialect or labeled in a certain lexicon as regional, that information might be accessible via the linked dictionaries. Overall, this resource doesn’t directly catalog dialectal words (no Gulf or Egyptian slang, for instance, unless they appear in MSA dictionaries). It sticks to standard Arabic concepts. (This means it meets our needs for MSA; dialect marking is a desirable but not critical criterion, and here it’s mostly neutral – not much dialect content to worry about.)
	•	Domain Coverage: Broad and balanced. The Arabic Ontology was built to cover “the majority of Arabic meanings” in a wide range of domains[30]. It includes everyday concepts as well as scientific/technical ones, since it benchmarks against rigorous sources. Concepts are classified in an ontology that spans physical, abstract, social, and other categories. They haven’t explicitly tagged domains like “Medical” or “Finance,” but the ontological classification inherently groups concepts (e.g., medical terms under a health branch). In addition, the integration of 150 lexicons means specialized terminology (legal, religious, etc.) is present and marked by source. The resource is likely as domain-diverse as Princeton WordNet, if not more in some areas (the team incorporated terms from Wikipedia and other multilingual lexicons for coverage[19]). For instance, it is known to include a formal taxonomy of animals, foods, etc., as well as philosophical and IT terms, given the authors’ interests.
	•	Quality Assurance: Strong. This resource has undergone extensive expert review. Each of the 1,300 core concepts was “well-investigated” by ontology experts[17]. The additional 11k were “partially validated” using semi-automatic methods and are being continually reviewed. The team published in a peer-reviewed journal (Applied Ontology, 2021) and demonstrated coverage evaluation. They claim the top levels of the ontology “can cover the majority of Arabic meanings” based on evaluation[30]. Moreover, inter-annotator agreement and consistency were ensured via formal definitions. Because it’s an ontology, every new addition had to be justified and placed correctly, which is a form of quality control. The project also launched a public search engine in 2018[31], inviting feedback from users. Overall, there is evidence of rigorous QA and continuous improvement.
	•	Maintenance and Community: Active. The Arabic Ontology is actively maintained. It had recent updates within the last 3 years – the portal and lexicon database were updated around 2018–2021, and presumably ongoing (the reference [114] in a 2022 survey calls it “forthcoming” content[32], implying continued development). The maintainer, Prof. Mustafa Jarrar (Birzeit University), is responsive to collaboration – his contact (mjarrar@birzeit.edu) is published[33]. The project also has ties with the Global WordNet Association. Given Birzeit’s public launch event in 2018[31], they showed commitment to open collaboration. We can likely obtain the data (perhaps under a non-commercial license or via a research MoU) and even contribute improvements.
	•	Access: Open for research use. The ontology is accessible online via a web portal (ontology.birzeit.edu) for search and browsing. For data access, one may need to request it; however, since it’s mapped to WordNet and Wikidata, some portions may be downloadable in RDF form. The authors mention mapping to lemon (Lexicon Model) format[34]. It’s not “commercial off-the-shelf,” but as an academic resource, it could be used under certain terms. We should contact Prof. Jarrar for the dataset and licensing details. Given its academic nature, it might be free for research and require permission for commercial deployment – this needs clarification.
	•	Known Limitations: The ontological approach, while yielding high quality, means some synsets might not exactly match PWN one-to-one. There could be cases where one Arabic Ontology concept corresponds to multiple English WordNet synsets or vice versa. This is usually a good thing (more natural for Arabic), but it requires careful handling in cross-lingual applications. Also, about 11k of the concepts are “partially validated” – there may be incomplete glosses or missing examples in those entries. We might need to invest effort to fully flesh out those if we adopt this resource. Finally, because it is a complex ontology, using it might have a learning curve (the data is richer than a simple WordNet). However, these are relatively minor drawbacks in light of its comprehensive coverage and quality.
	•	Azhary Arabic Lexical Ontology (2014) – Al-Azhar University project.
	•	Overview: Azhary is an Arabic lexical ontology presented by Ishkewy, Harb, & Farahat (2014)[35]. It was an academic effort to construct an Arabic WordNet-like resource by combining multiple Arabic dictionaries and following the EuroWordNet methodology. Azhary groups Arabic words into synsets (synonym sets) and encodes relations like hyponyms, antonyms, meronyms, etc., similar to WordNet. The motivation was to create a semantic network for Arabic that researchers can use (it’s described as a lexical ontology for AI and NLP tasks[36]).
	•	Coverage & Content: Azhary contains 13,328 synsets, encompassing 26,195 Arabic words (lemmas)[37]. This is notably larger than AWN v2’s ~9–11k synsets. The synsets and relations were built by mining three major Arabic-Arabic dictionaries: Al-Qāmūs al-Muḥīṭ, Al-Mu‘jam al-Wasīṭ, and As-Sihah (صحاح) among others[38][39]. The developers started with all unique words from the Holy Quran (77k tokens) as an initial word list[40], then expanded relations by manually linking words through dictionary definitions[38]. This yielded a broad-coverage network. Most synsets are nouns and verbs, but adjectives and adverbs that appeared in the dictionaries were included as well. (Precise POS breakdown isn’t given, but likely similar to AWN’s proportions, since they reference POS categories consistent with Arabic grammar[41].)
	•	Native Arabic Definitions: No, primarily relational. Azhary did not focus on providing glosses for each synset. Instead, it leveraged dictionary definitions indirectly: if two words were defined as synonyms of each other in the Arabic dictionaries, they were linked in the same synset[38][42]. However, the ontology itself doesn’t store a textual Arabic gloss per synset. The assumption is that the meaning is represented by the set of Arabic synonyms plus ontological relations. This means Azhary lacks explicit Arabic definitions for synsets (glosses might effectively be reconstructed by checking the dictionary sources, but they’re not compiled in one place). Thus it falls short of our critical requirement #1.
	•	Usage Examples: No built-in examples. The resource, as described, does not include example sentences. It was constructed from dictionaries and lists of words, focusing on semantic links rather than usage. We would have to attach example sentences ourselves or via external corpora if we used Azhary.
	•	Relations and Structure: Azhary is rich in semantic relations. It encodes not only synonymy sets but also hypernyms, hyponyms, antonyms, meronyms/holonyms, and associative relations between concepts[43][44]. For example, it knows that “hand (يد)” is a hyponym of “limb (عضو)”[45], and “doctor” is associated with “patient”[46]. This relational network could be very useful for our purposes (it’s something AWN v2 also had, but Azhary’s might be more extensive given the larger synset count).
	•	Cross-lingual Alignment: Partial. The authors state Azhary is “mappable straightforwardly onto PWN 2.0”[47]. It’s not clear if they actually provided mappings or simply meant the structure is compatible. Likely, each Azhary synset can be linked to an English synset because they built on WordNet design. But since they started from Arabic sources (Quran and Arabic dictionaries), some synsets might not neatly map to existing English WordNet synsets (especially culturally specific concepts). There isn’t mention of an Interlingual Index or explicit links. So, while conceptually alignable, we might have to create the mapping ourselves or find a later work that did the mapping. This is a potential limitation if interoperability is needed out-of-the-box.
	•	Diacritization: Azhary’s data likely includes voweled forms for many words, as they pulled from vocalized dictionary entries (e.g., Al-Wasīṭ and others provide vocalization). In the paper’s examples, they show diacritics on terms like “maʿrūf (مَعْرُوف)” and “ḥaqīd (حَقود)”[48]. However, consistency isn’t explicitly measured. We can expect that at least the Quran-derived vocabulary is fully vocalized (since Quranic text was the seed). The dictionary extraction would also have vowels. So it’s reasonable to assume a high percentage of lemmas are vocalized in Azhary – possibly well above 80%.
	•	Granularity: Because Azhary was built by merging multiple dictionaries, it may actually avoid some of the English-driven granularity issues. If an Arabic dictionary distinguished two senses of a word, the team might or might not have split them into separate synsets (the methodology isn’t fully detailed on this point). However, given they manually connected words via definitions, they likely merged words if they found them defined similarly, even if English would separate them. This suggests granularity is Arabic-informed. On the flip side, starting from the Quran vocabulary might bias it toward classical usage. Some modern senses or slang might be missing. Also, because it was a one-time effort in 2014, it might not include newer terminology. But overall, synonyms should be properly grouped since they cross-referenced authoritative Arabic dictionaries to ensure synonymy.
	•	Quality Assurance: Moderate. The relations were built via a “fully manual process” by the authors using known dictionaries[38]. This is good (expert curation) but also potentially subjective – we don’t know how many lexicographers worked on it or their criteria. The paper doesn’t mention an evaluation or inter-annotator agreement study. It was likely a smaller team. That said, the use of well-regarded dictionaries as the basis provides some confidence in correctness. For instance, if Al-Mu‘jam al-Wasīṭ says word A and B are synonyms, they trusted that. The resulting ontology was evaluated in the paper by comparing to AWN (they note it’s larger and addresses some gaps). But we should be aware this resource hasn’t seen widespread adoption or independent validation in the community. There could be inconsistencies or gaps not documented.
	•	Access: Availability is uncertain. The authors did not provide a public download in the paper. There is mention of an online system architecture (they used Protégé and Jena to store the ontology)[49], and even an example of RDF output[50]. It’s possible the ontology (named “Azhary”) was made accessible upon request or via a research repository. We found a reference to it on ResearchGate and arXiv, but no obvious download link. If needed, we might try contacting the authors (Hossam Ishkewy or colleagues at Al-Azhar University). It’s also worth checking if any later project built on Azhary. However, since it’s a 2014 resource and relatively obscure, obtaining it might be difficult.
	•	Known Limitations: The lack of Arabic glosses and examples is the biggest drawback relative to our must-haves. Essentially, Azhary is a WordNet skeleton (synsets and relations) without the descriptive text. We would have to add definitions to ~13k synsets ourselves, which is a huge task (similar to enriching AWN). Also, because it hasn’t been updated in many years, newer language developments aren’t covered. Another issue: Azhary started from Quran vocabulary, which skews classical; it might overemphasize archaic terms and underrepresent contemporary ones that weren’t in those dictionaries. Finally, mapping it to English WordNet might require work if we need that alignment (though presumably many synsets correspond, given the size is comparable to AWN’s). In summary, Azhary offers a head start with a bigger synset inventory and relations, but would need substantial further development to meet our critical requirements (glosses/examples).
	•	BabelNet (Arabic segment) – Multilingual Semantic Network.
	•	Overview: BabelNet is not an Arabic-specific WordNet, but a massively multilingual semantic network that integrates WordNet with Wikipedia and other resources[51]. We include it as an alternative lexical-semantic resource because it covers Arabic and might fill some gaps. BabelNet (version 5.x) contains 23+ million “Babel synsets”, which are concept nodes linked to words in 500+ languages[52]. Arabic is one of the covered languages. Essentially, if a concept appears in English WordNet or has a Wikipedia page, BabelNet likely has Arabic lexicalizations for it (via Arabic Wikipedia titles, translations, etc.).
	•	Coverage: Extensive. BabelNet’s Arabic vocabulary is far larger than any standalone Arabic WordNet. It reportedly includes millions of Arabic entries. For example, it would cover all ~11k AWN synsets (since AWN was integrated in it), plus Arabic names for many Wikipedia entities and additional concepts. This easily exceeds our 40k synset preference – indeed, virtually any concept with an Arabic Wikipedia article or Wikidata label will be present. For core vocabulary, coverage is excellent (near 100% of Swadesh concepts, etc.). It also spans open-domain and technical terms due to Wikipedia content.
	•	Arabic Definitions: Not consistently. BabelNet does store glosses for each synset, often taken from WordNet (English gloss) or Wikipedia article intros. If an Arabic Wikipedia page exists for a concept, BabelNet will include the Arabic summary as a gloss. However, many BabelNet synsets that come purely from WordNet will only have English glosses, since AWN v2 lacked Arabic ones. As of BabelNet 5.0, some effort was made to use machine translation for missing glosses, but quality varies. The bottom line: Arabic gloss coverage is far below 80%. It might be, say, 20-30% of synsets have an Arabic definition (corresponding to those with an Arabic Wikipedia entry). The rest have English descriptions. This is a problem for our “native definitions” criterion.
	•	Examples: No usage examples are provided in BabelNet. It’s strictly a lexico-semantic network. It doesn’t include example sentences from corpora.
	•	Cross-lingual Alignment: Excellent by design. Every BabelNet synset is inherently cross-lingual – it’s an interlingual concept with labels in many languages[53]. Arabic words in BabelNet synsets are linked to their equivalent English synset and to other languages’ words. This fulfills interoperability without extra effort. (If we needed to map an Arabic word to an English concept, BabelNet can do it via the Babel synset ID which is connected to WordNet IDs and Wikidata IDs.)
	•	Diacritization: None or inconsistent. BabelNet’s Arabic entries are generally unvocalized (as found in Wikipedia or other sources). For instance, the Arabic word for “cat” might appear as “قط” without diacritics. This could introduce ambiguity. There is no systematic diacritic policy in BabelNet; it simply collects strings as they appear in sources. So it fails our diacritization criterion.
	•	Granularity: Variable. Because BabelNet merges WordNet with other resources, it can sometimes over-generate senses. It might have duplicate synsets (WordNet concept vs. Wikipedia concept for the same thing) that are later merged, but some nuanced distinctions might persist. Also, BabelNet includes a lot of named entities from Wikipedia which are very fine-grained (e.g., every city, person, etc., is a synset). That could be seen as beyond our needs or could enrich domain coverage depending on perspective. The key point: BabelNet wasn’t curated by Arabic speakers, so it didn’t fix the granularity issues of AWN – it incorporates AWN v2 as-is, with all its lumps and splits. It then adds more content on top, which could further muddy certain areas (for example, multiple Arabic translations from different sources might all be listed under one concept, even if one is less common).
	•	Quality Assurance: Automated, not expert-reviewed for Arabic. BabelNet is built via algorithms. Arabic entries often come from machine translation or wiki extraction, which can introduce errors (e.g., incorrect translation of a sense, or outdated terminology from Wiktionary). There’s no manual validation for the majority of Arabic content. The overall quality for Arabic will be uneven – high for popular concepts (which likely have proper Arabic Wikipedia pages), and low for obscure ones (where Arabic may be auto-generated). We should treat BabelNet’s Arabic as a raw knowledge base, not a validated lexicon.
	•	Domain Coverage: Outstanding. One strong aspect is its breadth: from everyday words to proper nouns, scientific terms, historical figures – BabelNet covers it all if documented in any major language. It has domain labels inherited from WordNet and Wikipedia categories to some extent. In fact, BabelNet entries have been enriched with domain information in some versions[54]. So if we need, say, a medical term WordNet doesn’t have, BabelNet might have it via Wikipedia.
	•	Maintenance: Active (ongoing releases). BabelNet is actively maintained by researchers (latest version 5.3 in Dec 2023[55]). They release updates roughly yearly, incorporating new Wikipedia dumps, etc. So the Arabic content will grow as Wikipedia grows. However, this maintenance is general; they are not specifically curating Arabic, just pulling whatever data is available. The maintainers (Sapienza University, Rome) are responsive in terms of providing access (APIs, licenses) for research or commercial use (it’s free for research; commercial use requires a license purchase).
	•	Access: Available via an API or downloadable RDF/JSON for research. We can obtain BabelNet data under a research license easily. For commercial deployment, a licensing fee to Babelscape (the commercial arm) would be required. Integration effort is non-trivial (we’d have to query the API or host the multi-gigabyte database). Also, filtering only the useful parts (e.g., synsets with good Arabic glosses) would take some work.
	•	Use Case Fit: BabelNet could serve as a supplementary resource if no dedicated Arabic WordNet meets all needs. For example, we could use it to boost coverage (find Arabic translations for missing synsets) or to get domain-specific terms. But on its own, it does not meet our “high-quality Arabic WordNet” criteria, due to lack of consistent Arabic definitions and QA. It’s essentially a gigantic automatically-constructed WordNet++ with Arabic entries.
	•	Other Notable Mentions:
	•	Arabic FrameNet: While not a WordNet, projects like the Emirati Arabic FrameNet (EAFN) are building semantic frame lexicons for Arabic. EAFN (started 2015) has targeted ~1,000 lexical units (word senses) in Emirati dialect/MSA, each annotated with frames and example sentences[56][57]. It provides rich contextual info (frames and roles), which could complement a WordNet. However, its coverage is limited (still in progress) and focuses on predicate semantics rather than broad vocabulary. There is also a preliminary MSA FrameNet effort (University of Jordan, 2018) with a small number of frames. FrameNet could be useful if we need deep semantic relations (frames, roles) or examples for key verbs, but it’s not a substitute for a WordNet – rather a different resource.
	•	Arabic VerbNet/OntoNotes: Similarly, Arabic VerbNet (U. of Konstanz) and the OntoNotes Arabic lexicon provide structured verb information (classes of verbs with similar argument structures, and PropBank-style sense definitions for common verbs). For instance, OntoNotes (LDC) includes an inventory of senses for about 2,500 Arabic verbs (with English glosses and some Arabic explanations) used in their annotated corpus. If our project has a strong focus on verbs and their usage, these resources might be worth exploring. They won’t give full WordNet coverage, but they ensure consistent treatment of verbal semantics and could supply Arabic definitions for verbs that WordNets lack.
	•	Traditional Dictionaries with Semantic Links: We might consider leveraging curated Arabic dictionaries or thesauri. For example, the Arabic Language Academy’s Al-Mu‘jam Al-Wasīṭ (معجم الوسيط) is a modern standard dictionary that provides definitions in Arabic for ~40k entries. Some newer projects like “Al Maany” online aggregate multiple dictionaries and even list synonyms. While these aren’t pre-structured as WordNets, we could mine them to get Arabic definitions (for glosses) and identify synonym sets. Our evaluation attachments already use such sources (e.g., verifying AWN lemmas in Almaany[58]). An upside: these sources are authoritative and cover core MSA well (with diacritics and examples). A downside: they don’t have the explicit network of hypernyms/hyponyms that WordNet has, though Academy dictionaries sometimes imply hierarchy (e.g., a definition of a term often names its genus which is effectively a hypernym). If no existing WordNet suffices, one alternative approach is to build a custom lexical resource by combining an Arabic dictionary (for glosses) with bilingual links to WordNet (for structure). This is essentially what extending AWN entails – albeit one could choose a higher-quality dictionary for glosses.
Recommendation & Rationale
After analyzing the above candidates, our recommendation is to pursue the Arabic Ontology (Birzeit Arabic WordNet) as the primary resource, possibly in combination with the Revised AWN 3.0. This recommendation is based on the following considerations:
	•	Arabic Ontology meets almost all critical requirements: It offers native Arabic definitions for virtually every concept[59], and has a broad coverage (~20k synsets)[19] that aligns with our 20k–40k target. Its content is specifically designed for Arabic speakers, not just translated from English, ensuring definitions and synset groupings make sense in Arabic. It is aligned with international standards (ILI mappings to PWN) for interoperability. The presence of some Arabic usage examples and the linkage to a huge lexicographic database are additional bonuses that can help fill example sentences for core vocabulary. Moreover, the resource is under active maintenance by a community of experts and is accessible for collaboration, meaning we can get support or even contribute to improvements. Quality-wise, it’s hard to beat: the ontology approach resolved many of the inconsistency issues we found in AWN v2. Choosing this resource would drastically reduce the amount of work needed to reach our quality goals (since it was largely built with those goals in mind).
	•	AWN 3.0 could supplement coverage and ease transition: AWN 3.0, being a direct expansion of the AWN we evaluated, has the advantage of familiar structure and data format. It comes with fully added Arabic glosses and examples[5], which addresses AWN v2’s biggest weakness. However, its coverage (9.5k synsets) is only about half of what we need. We suggest using AWN 3.0 in tandem with the Arabic Ontology: for instance, AWN 3.0 can serve as a vetted subset of synsets (especially for basic concepts and verbs) with ready-to-use glosses and examples, while the Arabic Ontology can contribute the additional synsets (the remaining ~10k+ concepts) along with their Arabic definitions. In fact, because both are aligned to Princeton WordNet, we can merge the two resources relatively straightforwardly via their synset IDs. Where they overlap, AWN 3.0’s content can be cross-validated with the Arabic Ontology’s (likely they agree on many core concepts, and if not, those are cases to examine). Where one has coverage the other doesn’t (e.g., Arabic Ontology might include more cultural terms, AWN 3.0 might have certain phrasets or modern coinages), we incorporate both. This combined approach would yield an Arabic WordNet with ~20k synsets, each with an Arabic gloss (from one or both sources), many with examples, and thoroughly reviewed content. The resulting resource would fulfill all critical requirements and most high-priority ones (we’d still need to ensure diacritics and maybe add dialect tags if needed, but the heavy lifting of definitions and alignment is done).
	•	Alternative options like Azhary or BabelNet are less ideal: Azhary, though it has more synsets than AWN v2, lacks definitions/examples, meaning we’d face the same task of authoring Arabic glosses for ~13k synsets. It doesn’t save us effort on the must-haves, and its data may not be easily obtainable or current. BabelNet, while excellent for broad coverage, fails the quality criteria for native Arabic content and consistency – using it alone would be trading one set of issues for another (English-centric glosses for auto-generated ones). It’s best used as a auxiliary resource (e.g., to find missing translations or domain terms) rather than the primary lexicon for our project. FrameNet or PropBank are valuable in their niches but do not cover general vocabulary or provide the WordNet-style semantic relations we need for thousands of everyday words.
Next Steps with Arabic Ontology (and AWN 3.0): We should reach out to the maintainers of the Arabic Ontology to discuss access and potential collaboration. Prof. Mustafa Jarrar (Birzeit University) is the key contact[33]. He can provide the data (perhaps in RDF or CSV form) and insight on its use. Since our project is likely research-oriented, they may be open to a data-sharing agreement. We should also contact the AWN 3.0 team – Dr. Hadi Khalilia or Dr. Abed Freihat (emails at University of Trento/PTUK) – to obtain the AWN 3.0 dataset if it’s not publicly downloadable yet. Both resources are free for research; if our use is commercial, we’ll need to clarify license (AWN 3.0 might be CC BY-NC, Arabic Ontology not sure, possibly CC BY).
Combining the two will involve mapping their synsets (both map to PWN 3.0 synset IDs, so that’s manageable). Any discrepancies in glosses can be reconciled by our linguists. We will also need to plan filling any remaining gaps: for instance, Arabic Ontology may not have example sentences for every synset – we could use AWN 3.0’s examples where available, or take examples from dictionaries/corpora for others. Another task is diacritization consistency: we should decide on a policy (e.g. fully vowelize all headwords). Arabic Ontology’s lexicon could supply many diacritics; AWN 3.0 might need some editing to reach 80% vocalization (if it’s not there yet).
Despite these integration tasks, this path is far more efficient than extending AWN v2 from scratch. Essentially, Arabic Ontology + AWN 3.0 gives us a high-quality, high-coverage Arabic WordNet now, with relatively minor effort to polish and adapt to our exact needs.
Feasibility of Extending AWN v2 (if no suitable resource)
If neither the Arabic Ontology nor AWN 3.0 were available, the fallback is to extend and improve AWN v2 ourselves. Based on our evaluation and knowing what AWN 3.0 achieved, here is an estimate of the effort required to meet our requirements by manual extension:
	•	Arabic Definitions (~10k synsets): We would need to author Arabic glosses for ~9,916 synsets (to bring AWN’s 0% up to >80% coverage). This is a massive undertaking. For perspective, the AWN 3.0 team added glosses to all 9.5k synsets, updating ~58% of them with new info[5] – this likely took a dedicated team of linguists many months (if not several years) to complete. Assuming a skilled lexicographer could write 20–30 glosses per day, 10k glosses would require on the order of 350–500 person-days. In practice, it’s slower because one must ensure each gloss succinctly captures the sense and differentiate it from other senses. We could accelerate it by using existing Arabic dictionaries as a starting point (e.g., copying a definition from Al-Wasīṭ or Google Translate and then editing), but each will still need human refinement. A team of 4 linguists working full-time might accomplish this in around 6–8 months. Quality checks (reviewing each definition for accuracy and clarity) would add overhead.
	•	Arabic Example Sentences: We should provide examples at least for the core vocabulary (let’s say the most frequent 5,000 synsets). If we aim for one good Arabic example per synset, that’s 5k sentences. Crafting or finding these is labor-intensive but slightly easier than definitions because we can use corpora. Strategies include: searching an Arabic corpus or the web for the target word in context and selecting a suitable sentence, or translating an English WordNet example if applicable and adjusting to idiomatic Arabic. If each example takes ~10-15 minutes to find or write, 5,000 examples is ~1,250 hours of work (around 30 person-weeks). Crowdsourcing could be an option here (have native speakers suggest sentences), but would need curation.
	•	Reviewing and Fixing Synset Structure: We identified 782 synsets with probable over-lumping and 512 words with over-splitting. Each of these cases must be examined by an Arabic lexicographer:
	•	For over-lumped synsets (very large synsets containing odd members), the task is to split the synset into two or more proper synsets. For example, a synset that currently groups several unrelated meanings should be broken so that each meaning gets its own synset (with its appropriate Arabic gloss and aligned to the correct English sense if possible). This requires analyzing each synonym in that big cluster, determining which are true synonyms vs. which belong elsewhere. It’s essentially lexicographic surgery. If we assume each such synset takes 30–60 minutes to sort out (some may be easier, some harder), 782 synsets could require ~400–800 hours of expert work.
	•	For over-split words (a single Arabic word appearing in 10+ synsets due to English sense proliferation), the task is to decide which of those senses are truly distinct in Arabic. Likely many can be merged. We would consolidate those synsets and remove duplicates. For 512 words, if each needs ~20 minutes of analysis (checking each sense usage), that’s about 170 hours. Merging senses also implies updating glosses to cover the broader meaning, and possibly discarding some English-alignments if they are irrelevant.
	•	Additionally, we must fix incorrect lemmas, of which AWN v2 had many. AWN 3.0 reported deleting ~8,751 erroneous or duplicate lemma entries[12]. We’d need to go case by case through AWN’s list of lemmas and validate them against a dictionary. This could be partly automated (spell-checking against a lexicon), but manual confirmation is needed when deciding if, say, a form is an error or a rare valid term. Thousands of corrections could easily consume a few weeks of work.
	•	Adding Missing Entries: AWN v2 is only ~8.4% of the full English WordNet. To reach our coverage goal (let’s say ~30% of English WordNet, which is ~40k synsets), we’d have to add 20–30k new synsets. That is essentially a large-scale expansion. Doing this manually is impractical within a short timeframe. One approach is bootstrapping from bilingual resources: for instance, use machine translation or dictionaries to translate missing English synsets into Arabic, then validate them. This is exactly what earlier efforts did (e.g., methods by Abouenour et al. 2013 to add verbs and names[60][61]). If we attempted this, we’d likely use tools like BabelNet or Google Translate to get candidate Arabic for each missing synset, and then have linguists curate the results. Even then, integrating an additional ~20k synsets is a huge project on its own (comparable to building a new WordNet). It might be more realistic for us to target, say, an extra 10k synsets (to reach ~20k total). That alone would double AWN’s size. It might involve focusing on certain domains or frequencies – e.g., ensure all Swadesh/base vocab is covered (which AWN mostly has) and then important technical domains. This part is open-ended in effort; it could take years to fully match English WordNet. Therefore, we would likely prioritize quality (glosses, examples, cleanup) over sheer quantity if forced to choose.
In summary, extending AWN v2 to meet our requirements would be a resource-intensive endeavor. We estimate on the order of 1–2 person-years of skilled linguistic labor (spread across a team, could be 6+ months elapsed time) to add Arabic glosses, examples, and fix the known synset issues for the existing 11k synsets. Expanding coverage significantly beyond that would add further time (potentially another year for +10k synsets via semi-automatic means and validation).
By contrast, adopting an existing resource like the Arabic Ontology and collaborating with its maintainers is a far more efficient route. It gives us a leap to ~20k synsets with Arabic definitions now, rather than after years of work. We would then focus our effort on integration and targeted improvements (which is a more manageable scope). This is why we recommend leveraging those resources instead of reinventing the wheel.
Shortlist of Resources & Contacts
To summarize, here is our shortlist of 5 candidate resources with key details, and our recommendation marked:
	•	Arabic Ontology (Birzeit Arabic WordNet) – Version 2021, ~12k validated synsets (20k+ including under review)[17][19]. Coverage: Broad, cross-domain, ~20k concepts mapped to PWN. Arabic Content: 100% Arabic glosses; examples for many; high diacritic consistency. POS: All major POS, strong on nouns/verbs. Access: Open for research (contact Prof. Mustafa Jarrar, Birzeit Univ., via ontology.birzeit.edu). Maintenance: Active (last 3 years). Limitations: Partial completion of some entries; license for commercial use to be confirmed. ✅ Recommended as primary resource, given native quality and coverage.
	•	AWN 3.0 (Revised Arabic WordNet) – 2024 release, 9,576 synsets[8][9]. Coverage: Medium (covers core WordNet 2.0 set). Arabic Content: Arabic gloss + example for each synset[5]; many errors fixed; some diacritics. POS: ~66% nouns, 26% verbs, 5% adj, 1% adv (still sparse in adj/adv). Access: Free (expected via Global WordNet; contact Dr. Hadi Khalilia). Maintenance: One-time revision (future updates uncertain). Limitations: Only ~8–9k concepts, not enough by itself; license likely non-commercial. ✅ Recommended as complementary resource to merge with Arabic Ontology for best results.
	•	Azhary Lexical Ontology – 2014 (Azhar Univ.), 13,328 synsets[37], 26k words. Coverage: Decent (bigger than AWN2, includes classical terms). Arabic Content: Synonym sets and relations only – no glosses or examples. Some vocalization present. POS: Nouns, verbs dominant; has adj/adv from dictionaries. Access: Unclear (not publicly hosted; would need author contact). Maintenance: Inactive (one-time project). Limitations: Lacks definitions (violates critical requirement); older resource. Recommendation: Not ideal as primary choice due to missing glosses, but could be mined for additional relations or vocab if needed.
	•	BabelNet (Arabic) – v5.3 (2023), millions of synsets, ~23M overall[52]. Coverage: Excellent (includes virtually all concepts with Arabic translations). Arabic Content: Arabic labels for many synsets (from Wikipedia, etc.), but glosses mostly English (only translated if Arabic Wikipedia exists). No examples; no diacritics. POS: All types, plus named entities. Access: Free for research (API/download), commercial license needed otherwise. Maintenance: Active (regular releases). Limitations: Auto-generated content can be noisy; not curated for Arabic understanding. Recommendation: Use as auxiliary resource for gap-filling or cross-checking, rather than main resource.
	•	Arabic FrameNet / PropBank (various) – FrameNet (UAE Univ., ongoing), PropBank (LDC OntoNotes 2013). Coverage: Low (a few hundred to thousand lexical items each). Arabic Content: FrameNet has example sentences and frame definitions in English (some Arabic annotation); PropBank has Arabic verb sense definitions (usually short phrases, often aligned to English). POS: Focus on verbs (PropBank) and some nouns/adjectives (FrameNet frames). Access: FrameNet – research collaboration likely needed; PropBank – available via LDC OntoNotes corpus. Maintenance: FrameNet ongoing but small; PropBank static. Limitations: Not a general lexicon; useful for verb semantics and providing example usages for key verbs, but does not meet our WordNet needs broadly. Recommendation: Consider for supplemental use (especially if we need to enrich verb entries with detailed argument structure or want additional example sentences for those).
In conclusion, our plan is to acquire the Arabic Ontology data and AWN 3.0, merge and harmonize them, and thereby rapidly attain a high-quality Arabic WordNet that satisfies your project’s criteria. This approach leverages existing work by experts and minimizes duplication of effort. We will still allocate resources to verify and tweak the merged lexicon (especially for consistent diacritization and any coverage gaps), but this is far more tractable than starting from AWN v2’s deficient state. I will proceed to contact the maintainers of these resources and can keep you updated on access and integration progress.
Please let me know if you need any further information or if you have concerns about the recommended approach. We can also adjust the plan if, for example, licensing of the Arabic Ontology requires certain usage restrictions – in that case, we might consider a fallback of using AWN 3.0 plus targeted dictionary augmentations. However, at this point, the recommended path seems the most promising to deliver a robust Arabic lexical-semantic resource within a reasonable timeframe.
