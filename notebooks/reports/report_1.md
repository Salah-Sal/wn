Strategic Evaluation of High-Fidelity Arabic Lexical Resources: Alternatives to Open Multilingual Wordnet1. Executive Context and Strategic ImperativeThe effective processing of Natural Language (NLP) for Arabic—a language characterizing a diglossic spectrum, complex non-concatenative morphology, and a high degree of orthographic ambiguity—requires semantic resources of exceptional granularity and rigor. For nearly two decades, the development of such resources has been constrained by the dominance of the "Expand Model," a methodological approach that prioritizes the rapid translation of English conceptual structures (primarily the Princeton WordNet) over the cultivation of native lexicographic depth. The user’s assessment of the Open Multilingual Wordnet (omw-arb:1.4 / AWN v2) as fundamentally unsuitable for high-stakes semantic processing is not merely an internal finding; it is a validation of a broader, systemic critique emerging within the advanced computational linguistics community between 2021 and 2025.The limitations identified in the user's query—specifically the near-total absence of native Arabic definitions (glosses), the critical lack of usage examples, and the persistent issues with diacritization—render the legacy AWN v2 effectively obsolete for modern applications requiring deep semantic reasoning, such as Question Answering (QA), Semantic Search, and advanced Machine Translation (MT). A semantic resource that functions solely as a translation dictionary, lacking the intrinsic definitions necessary to distinguish between polysemous senses within the target language, fails the primary test of a WordNet: to serve as a reference for meaning, not just equivalence.This report serves as a comprehensive, deep-dive navigational guide to the "post-AWN v2" era. It posits that the solution to the identified deficit lies not in a de novo construction effort—which would require prohibitive linguistic labor estimated in the tens of thousands of hours—but in the strategic adoption of two emerging, high-fidelity resources that have matured significantly in recent years: the Arabic WordNet V3 (AWN V3) and the Arabic Ontology (Birzeit/SinaLab).Our extensive analysis of the literature indicates that AWN V3, a major revision detailed in 2024, directly remediates the user's primary pain points by introducing native glosses and examples to over 58% of the existing synsets and formally encoding "lexical gaps" to handle untranslatability.1 Parallel to this, the Arabic Ontology represents a paradigm shift from the "Expand Model" to a "Linguistic Ontology" model, providing roughly 17,000 rigorous, scientifically benchmarked concepts rooted in a massive database of 150 digitized Arabic lexicons.2This document evaluates these candidates against the user's four stringent requirements: Native Definitions (>80%), Usage Examples, Adequate Coverage (>20k synsets), and Cross-lingual Alignment. It further explores the theoretical and practical feasibility of utilizing frame-semantic resources like the emerging Arabic FrameNet and the Universal PropBank to supplement the core lexical database, while strictly advising against the manual extension of the legacy AWN v2 resource.2. Forensic Analysis of Legacy Infrastructure: The Failure of AWN V2To chart the path forward, one must first dissect the structural and content-based failures of the incumbent resource. The Arabic WordNet (AWN) project, initially launched in 2006, was a pioneering effort to align Arabic with the Princeton WordNet (PWN). However, the version currently propagated through the Open Multilingual Wordnet (OMW) infrastructure, known as AWN v2 or omw-arb, suffers from systemic stagnation and methodological flaws that have compounded over time.2.1 The "Translation" Trap and the Limitations of the Expand ModelThe foundational flaw of AWN v2 lies in its construction methodology, known as the "Expand Model." In this approach, synsets (sets of synonyms) from the Princeton WordNet (PWN) are translated into Arabic.2 While efficient for generating a skeleton structure, this method inherently biases the resource toward English conceptualizations. The critique provided in the user's query—that the resource lacks native Arabic definitions—is a direct, unavoidable consequence of this model. The "glosses" in AWN v2 are often either missing entirely or are mere translations of English definitions that fail to capture the nuances of the Arabic lemma.1Research indicates that AWN v2 contains approximately 11,269 synsets.1 While this was a milestone in 2008, it falls drastically short of the coverage required for modern NLP, which typically demands 50,000+ concepts to cover open-domain text. Furthermore, the reliance on translation led to significant "correctness" issues. A 2024 audit of AWN v2 revealed that many synsets contained incorrect lemmas, repeated words, or fundamentally wrong mappings due to polysemy in the source English text.6For instance, without a native Arabic gloss to anchor the meaning, a translator might map the Arabic word for "bank" (financial institution) to the English synset for "bank" (river side), creating semantic noise that propagates downstream to any system using the resource. This is not a trivial error; it is a systemic corruption of the semantic network that renders Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) algorithms ineffective. If the resource cannot tell the difference between a river bank and a financial bank in its own definitions, no algorithm trained on it can be expected to do so reliably.2.2 The Absence of Diacritization and Morphological DepthArabic is a morphologically rich language where diacritics (Harakat) function not merely as phonetic guides but as semantic determiners. The word "ktb" can be kataba (he wrote), kutib (it was written), or kutub (books), depending entirely on diacritization. The legacy AWN resources often lack consistent, full diacritization, leading to massive ambiguity.7 This necessitates the use of complex morphological analyzers just to query the WordNet, introducing a pipeline latency and a potential point of failure.The "root-and-pattern" nature of Arabic derivational morphology is also poorly represented in the standard WordNet hierarchy, which was designed for the concatenative morphology of English.8 AWN v2 attempts to force Arabic verbs and nouns into the English is-a (hypernymy) hierarchies, often severing the semantic link between a root (e.g., K-T-B) and its derivatives (writer, library, book). This results in a resource that feels "alien" to the internal logic of the Arabic language, treating derivatives as atomistic words rather than interconnected morphological families.2.3 Structural Stagnation and Coverage GapsThe structural stagnation of AWN v2 is evident in its inability to handle domain-specific terminology or cultural concepts that do not exist in English. Because it relies on the English WordNet as a "pivot," concepts unique to Arab culture, Islamic jurisprudence, or specific regional geography are often excluded or mapped awkwardly to the nearest English approximate. This results in "Lexical Gaps" that are simply ignored in V2, leaving the user with a resource that is silent precisely where it needs to be most expressive.The statistics are telling: Table 1 comparisons in the literature show that while English WordNet covers 67.5% of its estimated lexicon, the released AWN v2 covers only about 9.7% of the Arabic lexicon.5 This massive gap in coverage forces developers to rely on fallback mechanisms, such as machine translation or bilingual dictionaries, which lack the semantic relations (synonymy, hypernymy) that justify using a WordNet in the first place.2.4 Conclusion on AWN V2The user's internal evaluation is validated by the literature. AWN v2 is a "legacy" artifact. It served as a proof-of-concept but lacks the lexical density (definitions and examples) required for semantic reasoning. Continuing to invest in cleaning AWN v2 manually would be a sunk-cost fallacy, especially given the emergence of superior, architecturally distinct alternatives discussed in the following sections.3. The Primary Candidate: Arabic WordNet V3 (AWN V3)The most direct and compelling answer to the user's request for an alternative is the Arabic WordNet V3, formally introduced in the 2024 paper "Advancing the Arabic WordNet: Elevating Content Quality" by Freihat, Khalilia, Bella, and Giunchiglia.1 This resource is not merely an incremental update; it is a systematic remediation of the very deficits identified by the user, representing a shift from a "quantity-first" to a "quality-first" development philosophy.3.1 Meeting Requirement 1 & 2: Native Definitions and ExamplesThe defining characteristic of AWN V3 is its shift from quantity to quality. The development team recognized that existing wordnets suffer from "correctness and completeness" issues, specifically the lack of glosses.6 This recognition led to a complete overhaul of the content generation pipeline.Methodology: The V3 project employed a semi-automatic approach followed by rigorous human validation to add glosses and examples. This was not a simple ingestion of data; it involved a "Task Generation" phase where data from AWN V1 was collected, followed by "Task Enhancement" where translators were explicitly instructed to understand the synset before writing a definition.9Qualitative Shift: Unlike V2, which relied on translation equivalency, V3 focuses on "synset understanding." Translators were tasked with understanding the PWN synset and then writing a native Arabic gloss that accurately describes the concept, rather than translating the English gloss verbatim.9 This directly addresses the user's requirement for >80% native definitions. The instruction to use external resources like Wikipedia to grasp the concept before defining it ensures that the Arabic definition stands on its own semantic feet.Examples: The update includes the addition of usage examples for the lemmas, allowing for context-aware disambiguation.9 This is critical for training machine learning models that rely on context vectors to distinguish between word senses.Statistics: The project successfully updated more than 58% of the synsets of the existing Arabic WordNet with this new, high-quality content.1 While this does not yet reach 100%, it represents a massive leap over the 0% native gloss rate of V2.3.2 Handling Language Diversity: Phrasets and Lexical GapsOne of the most sophisticated features of AWN V3 is its explicit handling of untranslatability, a phenomenon frequently encountered when mapping English concepts to Arabic. This "Language Diversity" approach is a major theoretical contribution of the V3 project.Lexical Gaps: In V2, if an English concept (e.g., "shallow") had no direct single-word equivalent in Arabic, it was either ignored or mapped incorrectly. AWN V3 introduces explicit "Lexical Gap" markers, informing the system that the concept exists in the interlingual index (ILI) but has no single-word lexicalization in Arabic.1 This prevents "forced" mappings that degrade quality and alerts downstream applications that a concept cannot be lexicalized simply.Phrasets: To bridge these gaps, V3 introduces "phrasets"—free combinations of words used to express a concept that lacks a single lemma. For example, the concept of "someday" (some unspecified time in the future) is identified as a lexical gap in Arabic. V3 maps this to the phraset fi ywam min al-ayyam ("in a day from the days").9 This is crucial for maintaining the dense connectivity of the network without compromising lexical purity. It allows the WordNet to retain the concept node without fabricating a word that doesn't exist.3.3 Coverage and Polysemy ReductionWhile the absolute number of synsets in V3 is an extension of V1/V2 (bringing it to the 11k–12k range initially, with ongoing expansions), the effective coverage is higher because the polysemy has been reduced. The authors identified that PWN suffers from "specialization polysemy" (too many fine-grained senses that are indistinguishable in other languages). AWN V3 collapses these redundant senses, resulting in a cleaner, more navigable graph.4This reduction in "sense enumeration" and "compound noun polysemy" means that while the node count might seem comparable to V2, the precision of the graph is significantly higher. The user will encounter fewer duplicate senses and less semantic clutter when querying the resource.3.4 Availability and AccessAWN V3 is linked to the DataScientia initiative and the Universal Knowledge Core (UKC) project.10 This implies it is available for research and potentially commercial licensing through the associated university spin-offs or repositories.Access Point: The resource is associated with the University of Trento and the UKC database.9Data Format: It utilizes the Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) and is compatible with modern semantic web standards.12 This ensures that it can be integrated into modern NLP pipelines that expect standard XML or JSON formats.Assessment: AWN V3 is the "spiritual successor" to the resource the user is currently using. It fixes the definitions and examples. However, its total synset count (~12k verified) may still fall short of the >20k coverage requirement unless it is combined with the resources discussed in Section 4.4. The Ontological Alternative: The Arabic Ontology (SinaLab)If AWN V3 represents the evolution of the lexicon, the Arabic Ontology represents the imposition of scientific rigor on Arabic semantics. Developed at SinaLab (Birzeit University) under the leadership of Prof. Mustafa Jarrar, this resource is arguably the most sophisticated semantic resource for Arabic currently in existence.2 It fundamentally reimagines the structure of the resource, moving away from the "Expand Model" toward a "Linguistic Ontology" model.4.1 "Ontologically Clean" Semantics vs. Linguistic IntuitionThe Arabic Ontology distinguishes itself by rejecting the standard "WordNet" assumption that speakers' beliefs drive meaning. Instead, it builds a formal ontology where concepts are defined based on intrinsic, distinguishing properties benchmarked against scientific knowledge.2Critique of WordNet Taxonomy: The project explicitly critiques the loose taxonomies of PWN. For example, PWN classifies "Morning Star" and "Evening Star" as different concepts, whereas the Arabic Ontology, adhering to scientific truth, recognizes them as the same instance (Venus) seen at different times.2 Similarly, it corrects the classification of numbers (Real, Rational, Integer) which are often muddled in linguistic networks.Why this matters: In standard WordNets, "Salt" might be classified under "Food" or "Spice" based on usage. In the Arabic Ontology, it is classified based on its chemical nature, with "usage" relations linking it to food. This supports much more powerful inferencing for AI systems, allowing for reasoning that transcends simple word association.Structure: It follows the WordNet structure (nodes are sets of synonyms) but enforces strict ontological subsumption (Is-A relations).13 This makes it a "Formal Arabic WordNet."4.2 The Lexicographic Database: Solving the Coverage and Definition ProblemThe Arabic Ontology is massive in scope, leveraging a digitized database of 150 multilingual lexicons.2 This is the key to meeting the user's requirements for definitions and examples.Core Ontology: Consists of ~1,300 top-level, fully axiomatized concepts.2Extended Content: Contains roughly 17,000 concepts/synsets as of 2023.14 While this is slightly under the 20k threshold, the density of the lexical entries mapped to these concepts is enormous.Lexicographic Database: The ontology sits atop a database of 2.4 million lexical entries and 1.1 million lexical concepts derived from digitized dictionaries.3 This means that while the "formal ontology" nodes are ~17k, the vocabulary coverage is virtually exhaustive for standard Arabic.Native Definitions: Because the ontology is mapped to 150 dictionaries (including classical giants like Lisan Al-Arab and modern glossaries like UNDP terms), it provides access to millions of native Arabic definitions. These are not translations; they are the original definitions from the lexicographic tradition of the language.15Usage Examples: Similarly, usage examples are extracted directly from the corpus of these dictionaries, ensuring high-quality, authentic contexts for every term.4.3 Meeting the RequirementsRequirement 1 (Native Definitions): Met and exceeded. The resource provides access to definitions from 150 distinct sources.Requirement 2 (Usage Examples): Met through the lexicographic database integration.Requirement 3 (Coverage): The ontology core is ~17k, but the searchable lexical space is >1 million concepts. This effectively solves the coverage issue for any practical application.Requirement 4 (Cross-Lingual Alignment): The ontology is fully mapped to Princeton WordNet (PWN), Wikidata, and other resources.2 This ensures that an application can query in English (via PWN ID) and retrieve the Arabic Ontological concept.4.4 Technical Accessibility and StandardsSinaLab provides state-of-the-art access methods that are compatible with modern web standards.Search Engine: The ontology is accessible via a robust search engine at https://ontology.birzeit.edu.2API: A JSON-based API is available for querying concepts, translations, synonyms, and definitions. API keys are provided offline upon request.16SinaTools: The lab has released an open-source toolkit, SinaTools, which includes morphological analyzers and lemmatizers specifically tuned to work with the ontology.17 This solves the "diacritization" issue by providing a dedicated pre-processing pipeline that aligns user text with the ontology's entries.Standards: Uses W3C Lemon/RDF models for representation, making it ready for Knowledge Graph integration.19Assessment: The Arabic Ontology is the "Rolls-Royce" option. It offers high precision and native depth. Its connection to 150 dictionaries provides the "Native Definitions" and "Examples" in abundance, far surpassing what any standalone WordNet could offer.5. Automated High-Coverage and Domain-Specific AlternativesWhile AWN V3 and the Arabic Ontology focus on high-quality manual/semi-manual curation, the user's requirement for ">20k synsets" might necessitate looking at automated resources or domain-specific ontologies to fill the gaps.5.1 LughaNet: The Automated Large-Scale OptionLughaNet represents a recent (2025 context) effort to automate the expansion of Arabic WordNet using modern Large Language Models (LLMs).Methodology: It aligns PWN synsets with Arabic words using bilingual dictionaries and LLM machine translation, followed by frequency-based filtering.20Coverage: It claims to produce 85,991 synsets.20 This massively exceeds the 20k requirement and provides the broadest possible net for capturing rare terms.Quality Caveat: The evaluation indicates roughly 64% coverage of dictionary terms. Being automated, it likely suffers from the same "translation gloss" issues as AWN v2, unless it specifically integrated a definitional extraction pipeline. It is recommended as a backfill resource for rare concepts not covered by the Arabic Ontology.5.2 Azhary (Al-Azhar University): The Islamic Domain SpecialistAzhary is a lexical ontology containing 26,195 words organized in 13,328 synsets.21Comparison: It was explicitly built to contrast with AWN, correcting errors in meanings and "stuck words" (concatenation errors) found in AWN.21Focus: Strong on Islamic and Quranic domain ontology, utilizing sources like Mushaf Al-Tajweed. It records relationships like synonyms, antonyms, and hypernyms with a focus on classical Arabic correctness.Status: It appears to be an academic project; availability might be limited to direct contact with authors at Al-Azhar University. However, for projects dealing with religious text, it is indispensable.5.3 Majeed: The Quranic English WordNet (QEWN)For projects specifically targeting the Quran, the Majeed project (Quranic English WordNet) offers a specialized resource.Structure: It builds a "Vocabulary of Quranic Concepts (VQC)" organized hierarchically.22 It augments the WordNet structure with relations specific to the Quran.Coverage: It identifies important concepts from English translations and organizes them using the term-head principle.23 While highly specific, it demonstrates the feasibility of domain-specific WordNets.6. Event Semantics: PropBank and FrameNetThe user specifically asked about PropBank and FrameNet. It is crucial to distinguish these resources from WordNets. WordNets describe entities and their taxonomic relations (is-a). PropBanks and FrameNets describe events and their participants (who did what to whom). They are complementary, not interchangeable.6.1 Arabic PropBank (APB) and Universal PropBankCurrent Status: The Arabic PropBank is a mature resource, heavily annotated on the An-Nahar Newswire (Modern Standard Arabic). It covers approximately 3,220 verb frame files and 1,940 nominal frame files.24Universal PropBank (UP): A massive project (UP 2.0 covers 23 languages). The Arabic portion is generated via annotation projection from English SRL data. While it aligns with English frames, it is often "silver standard" (semi-automatic).25Relevance: APB provides the "argument structure" (e.g., eat takes an Agent and Food). It does not typically provide the dictionary definitions the user is asking for. It is essential for extracting structured data from unstructured text (SRL), but it will not help with Word Sense Disambiguation in the way a WordNet does.6.2 Arabic FrameNet: A Work in ProgressStatus: The Arabic FrameNet landscape is fragmented and early-stage.Emirati Arabic FrameNet (EAFN): Focuses on dialect/MSA but is in initial stages, utilizing the Emirati Arabic Corpus.26Arabic FrameNet (AFN): An attempt to build a core using "The Great Thesaurus," but reports characterize it as a "first step".27Feasibility: FrameNets are notoriously difficult to build because they require defining complex scenarios (Frames) rather than just words. There is no resource currently available that meets the ">20k synset" equivalent in frames. This path is not recommended for immediate deployment as a primary semantic resource.7. Feasibility Analysis: Construction vs. AdoptionThe user explicitly asked about the "Construction Feasibility (effort to extend AWN v2)."The Verdict: Do Not Build from Scratch.The effort to manually extend AWN v2 to meet the stated requirements (adding native definitions and examples to 10k+ synsets) is estimated to require thousands of hours of expert lexicographer time.Precedent: The AWN V3 team has already performed this exact task using a "Task Generation - Enhancement - Validation" workflow involving human translators and validators.9Scale: The Arabic Ontology team has spent over 9 years digitizing 150 lexicons to build their resource.3Replicating this work would be redundant and economically inefficient. The "effort to extend" has effectively been completed by the teams at SinaLab and the University of Trento. The feasible path is integration, not construction. The existence of LughaNet also suggests that if expansion is needed, automated methods are now viable, further reducing the need for manual construction.8. Strategic Recommendations and DeliverablesBased on the evaluation of "Native Definitions," "Usage Examples," "Coverage," and "Alignment," we propose the following tiered strategy for the user's project.8.1 Shortlist of CandidatesCandidateTypeKey StrengthCoverageNative Defs1.

It fundamentally solves the "Definition" and "Example" deficit by referencing a massive database of digitized dictionaries. It provides the API access necessary for software integration and uses modern W3C standards (Lemon/RDF). It is the only resource that moves beyond the "translation" paradigm to offer true Arabic lexicography.Secondary Recommendation: Arabic WordNet V3If the project pipeline is strictly designed for Princeton WordNet IDs and requires a local, downloadable dataset (rather than an API), AWN V3 is the best-in-class "WordNet" (as opposed to Ontology). It is cleaner, richer, and more accurate than V2, and its handling of lexical gaps is state-of-the-art.Supplementary Recommendation:For coverage holes (concepts beyond the 17k/12k core), utilize LughaNet's data as a fallback layer, flagging it as "silver" quality.8.3 Contact Information1.

Insights on Future TrajectoriesThe shift from AWN v2 to resources like the Arabic Ontology signals a maturation in the Arabic NLP field. We are moving away from resources that "mimic" English structures toward resources that respect the internal logic of Arabic while maintaining interoperability via standard mapping (ILI/PWN).The "Definition" Bottleneck: The user's frustration stems from a historical artifact of NLP history—the assumption that structure (synsets) matters more than content (definitions). Modern LLMs and semantic search engines require the content (the gloss) to perform accurate embedding and retrieval. The shift to AWN V3 and Arabic Ontology represents the field's correction of this historical oversight.Dialectal Integration: The research highlights a growing trend of integrating dialects (Egyptian, Levantine) into these resources (e.g., Currasat corpus, EAFN).28 While the user asked for MSA, future-proofing the project implies selecting a resource that can handle diglossia. The Arabic Ontology/SinaLab ecosystem is explicitly working on this by integrating dialect corpora.29The path forward is clear: abandon the legacy "Expand Model" resource and adopt the "Linguistic Ontology" paradigm. The feasibility of "extending" the old resource is low compared to the immediate, high-impact value of adopting these new, scientifically validated assets.
